# Thread-Synchronization-LO41

The goal of this project was to experiment with thread synchronization. Here, we implement a railway: each train represent a thread and they must synchronize in order to avoid collision and deadlock.

# Instructions
The program can be compiled using the Makefile (typing "Make" with the right privileges). The program then expect one argument at execution which is the number of trains.
